<h3>
<i class="fas fa-handshake" aria-hidden="true"><span class="dp-icon-content" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></i>Course Policies</h3>
<p>Requirements for make-up exams, assignments, and other work in this course are consistent with university policies that can be found on <a class="inline_disabled" href="http://catalog.ufl.edu/UGRD/academic-regulations/attendance-policies/" target="_blank">UF's Attendance Policies</a>&nbsp;website.</p>
<p>As this is an online class, you are responsible for observing all posted due dates and are encouraged to be self-directed and take responsibility for your learning.</p>
<h4><strong>Assessments</strong></h4>
<p>Assessments serve four purposes. The instructor uses them to determine how well the class has mastered areas of knowledge and skill that students; the instructor also uses them to evaluate individual students in order to assign them a grade, as required by the university. The student can use assessments to judge how well they have mastered areas of knowledge and skill and some types of assessments present learning opportunities for the student to develop greater knowledge and skill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This course will have several types of assessments serving various objectives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5 class=""><strong>Quizzes</strong></h5>
<p>Quizzes will be discussed at the beginning of the discussion meetings. The objective is to test your understanding of the material you are assigned (lecture videos and readings). The purpose of quizzes is to motivate the students to read the assigned sections and watch lectures, and for the instructor to determine how well the material has been understood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Examinations</strong></h5>
<p>Examinations will have two parts: a quiz-style section and a free-response section. The quiz-style part will mostly gauge how well the student has mastered the basics of operating system components, policies, methods, and analysis. These will typically be fill-in-the-blank text or numerical answers, although some will be multiple-choice or matching questions.</p>
<p>Free-response questions require the student to engage with the material in a deeper way - not simply regurgitate material from the text or lectures. The questions may concern the design of a system to achieve a particular purpose in a given context or to analyze and evaluate one or more proposed solutions to a problem. The purpose is to gauge how well the basics taught in the course can be applied to a problem, and to give the student an opportunity to develop more by applying the knowledge and skills they have acquired.</p>
<p>To prepare for exams, mastery of the basics covered in lectures, quizzes, exercises, and projects is a must. The best way to prepare is to ask yourself (or your study group) how the new material relates to earlier material and how it could be applied to solve problems. Do all of this well before the exam, and get a good night's rest the night before. When you take the test, be sure to read the question carefully before you answer it, and to read it again when you are done. The questions are not intended to "trick" you or to humiliate you, but to get you to think beyond the basics you could get from a crib sheet or the text.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Exercises and Projects</strong></h5>
<p><strong>The discussion periods will mainly be devoted to explaining projects and exercises</strong>. Exercises are mostly short programming/writing assignments designed to develop the skills and experience you will need to do the projects. These will usually be expected to take no more than an hour to complete.</p>
<p><strong>Projects are more substantive and involve modifying the Reptilian Linux operating system</strong>. For these, the amount of time you will need may vary widely, but these are multi-week projects, so <strong>get started early</strong>. If you get done sooner, great; but if you run into snags, make sure you have the time needed to recover. Your best strategy is to map out existing OS functionality related to the project, including directories, files, structures, variables, and functions that may be relevant. Understand how these work together, then plan how you will introduce the changes needed to complete the project. The compile time is likely to be much longer than the times you are used to from small, application programs, and builds can take well over half an hour, so plan your changes and manage your schedule carefully to allow for enough iterations to complete your work. Bear in mind that you cannot run a debugger on the OS directly, since it has to provide services to all programs, including the debugger! <strong>Waiting until the last few days to start a project is a sure recipe for disaster</strong>.</p>
<p>Projects are intended to help develop the skills and knowledge needed to understand and modify a large, legacy codebase successfully. This will take time, and there is no substitute for spending the effort to understand the system first, then plan and execute the modifications, then thoroughly test that these work correctly. <strong>Projects also require documentation in the form of a report and man pages when appropriate</strong>. The report explains what you did, how, why, and how you know it is right (or where it is not if it falls short in any way). Man pages are the standard Unix way to provide online documentation of commands, system calls, libraries, formats, etc.</p>
<p>Getting familiar with Unix commands and system calls will help greatly, as will developing a good understanding of how the Linux kernel works. There are many books and online tutorials on Unix, and every Unix system provides an online manual (type "man man" to learn more).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>General Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p><strong>This is probably going to be one of the most challenging courses you take as an undergraduate</strong>. There is a great deal of material to cover, even to address the most basic issues in operating systems. It is important to keep up with the reading and viewing and to start on homework and projects early. It is like drinking from a firehose, and you will need some time to digest the material you read/view, so give yourself that time.</p>
<p>It is crucial to remember that getting a grade in this course is not the reason you came to UF; not even getting your bachelor's degree is the prize you seek. Your goal is to figure out where you fit in society and what career you will pursue to build a fulfilling trajectory doing something you love to do and are good at. The ability to apply the knowledge and skills you have acquired to the challenges of importance in your discipline contributes to the success of everyone - whether at a company, university, or other institution. It does not do you any good to be given a good grade or a degree if you do not have the competence to get the job done in your career. Take advantage of this opportunity to acquire the knowledge and develop the skills you will need to exercise in your career. If you get into trouble and are wedged, then seek help from the instructor, peer mentors, teaching assistants, and your classmates to get you over the hump. At the same time, do not look for answers to be handed to you - go out and develop them.&nbsp;</p>

<li>When in doubt use a virtual background. If you choose to use one, you should test the background out first to make sure your device can support it.</li>
<li>Your background can express your personality, but be sure to avoid using backgrounds that may contain offensive images and language.</li>

<li>Mute is your friend, especially when you are in a location that can be noisy. <span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;">Don’t leave your microphone open if you don’t have to. </span>
</li>
<li><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;">If you want to speak, you can raise your hand (click the “raise hand” button at the center bottom of your screen) and wait to be called upon.</span></li>

<i class="fas fa-file-invoice" aria-hidden="true"><span class="dp-icon-content" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></i>Tips for Success</h3>
<p>Taking a course online can be a lot of fun! Here are some tips that will help you get the most of this course while taking full advantage of the online format:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule "class times" for yourself. It is important to do the coursework on time each week. You will receive a reduction in points for work that is turned in late!</li>
<li>Read ALL of the material contained on this site. There is a lot of helpful information that can save you time and help you meet the objectives of the course.</li>
<li>Print out the Course Summary located in the Course Syllabus and check things off as you go.</li>
<li>Take full advantage of the online discussion boards. Ask for help or clarification of the material if you need it.</li>
<li>Do not wait to ask questions! Waiting to ask a question might cause you to miss a due date.</li>
<li>Do your work well before the due dates. Sometimes things happen. If your computer goes down when you are trying to submit an assignment, you'll need time to troubleshoot the problem.</li>
<li>To be extra safe, back up your work to an external hard drive, thumb drive, or through a cloud service.</li>
</ul>
