<p><strong><em>Attendance Policy, Class Expectations, and Make-Up Policy</em></strong></p>
<p>You are expected to attend class. There will be class activities which will be graded and count toward your final grade. Excused absences must be consistent with university policies in the undergraduate catalog (<a class="external" href="https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/regulations/info/attendance.aspx" target="_blank"><span>https://catalog.ufl.edu/ugrad/current/regulations/info/attendance.aspx</span><span class="screenreader-only">&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</span></a>) and require appropriate documentation.</p>
<p>You may discuss assignments with other students. But you must write the code by yourself. If one submission is proven to be copied from another student or directly from the internet, 0 point will be given.</p>
<p>Late assignments will be accepted with a penalty of deduction of 10% of the maximum point value every 12 hours, for up to 3 days.</p>
