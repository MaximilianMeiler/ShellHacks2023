In short, CISE advising seeks to cultivate students to be self\n-\naware and reflective in \ntheir format\nion in the field of study, both now and beyond UF.\n \nThis is what we refer to as engaged \nlearnin\ng, and i\nt is through engaged learning that we expect to see \ntransformative experiences for \nstudents. \nSo, s\nuccessful advi\nsing leads to engaged learning\n \nwhich resul\nts in transformative \noutcomes.\n \nTo\n \nembark on engaged learning\n \nis to approach the educational process and pathway with intentional, \nthoughtful, self\n-\nreflexive, and outward\n-\nlooking practices. \nBeing engaged is to be on the pathway of self\n-\ndiscovery as one is o\npenly \nlearning\n \nthe depths of the field \nand\n \nproactively exploring\n \nopportunities \nfor \nprofessional development\n. \nThis approach seeks to create space for deep engagement in the student’s \nlearning, allowing passions to emerge and to be explored, \ncultivating meaning\n-\nmaking exper\niences as a \npractitioner in the\n \ndiscipline, and \neventually \nemploying the student’s work in the field for the \nbetterment of society.\n \nAcademic Advising is a partnership that requires both the student and advisor to be actively\n \nengag\ned in \nthe process. Student and a\ndvisor expectations and responsibilities are outlined below.
